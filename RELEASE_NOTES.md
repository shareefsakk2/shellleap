# 🚀 ShellLeap v0.1.0 - The Secure Frontier

We are thrilled to announce the first official release of **ShellLeap**, the advanced SSH & SFTP client designed for speed, security, and a premium user experience.

### ✨ What's New
*   **🔐 Military-Grade Vault**: All your server credentials and private keys are now protected by industry-standard **AES-256-GCM encryption**.
*   **🔑 Seamless OS Integration**: Set your master password once, and ShellLeap will securely remember it using your system's hardware-backed keychain (GNOME Keyring/KWallet).
*   **📁 Advanced SFTP Management**: Full support for file transfers, directory management, and high-fidelity file permissions (Chmod).
*   **💻 Redesigned Terminal**: Optimized terminal re-attachment logic for a perfect, lag-free session history when switching views.
*   **🎨 Premium UI/UX**: Replaced all native browser popups with custom, high-fidelity dark-themed modals for a consistent, professional feel.

### 🛡️ Security First
Your security is our priority. With this release, we've implemented a **Zero-Knowledge** architecture:
- Your master password is never stored on disk.
- Data is only decrypted in memory when needed.
- Local storage is fully encrypted, ensuring your keys stay private even if your hardware is compromised.

### 📦 Installation (Linux)
1. Download the `shell-leap_0.1.0_amd64.deb` package.
2. Install via terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ./shell-leap_0.1.0_amd64.deb
